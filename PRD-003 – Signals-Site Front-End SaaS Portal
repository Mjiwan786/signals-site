Repo: signals-site (Next.js Front-End)

Title: PRD-003 – Signals-Site Front-End SaaS Portal
Version: 1.0
Date: [Today]
Owner: Front-End/Product UX Lead

Executive Summary

We will build and validate the SaaS front-end portal for end-users subscribing to our crypto-AI signal service. Built with Next.js + Tailwind, deployed to Vercel, it will integrate authentication (Discord via NextAuth), subscription flow (Stripe), and live signal streaming via SSE from the API. The front-end will display live signal dashboards (entry/exit events, PnL chart, historical data), user subscription status, and basic account management. Success: conversion rate (visitor → subscriber) > 5 % in beta, live signals rendering within 500 ms of publication, and zero major UI/UX bugs in first 100 user sessions.

Problem Statement

Without a polished front-end, users cannot easily subscribe, view live signals, or interpret the output of the core engine. This reduces adoption, trust, and monetization potential for the overall system.

Goals & KPIs

Live signal UI latency (API to UI render) median ≤ 400 ms.

Subscription conversion: at least 5% of visited plans page result in paid subscription during beta.

User satisfaction: net promoter score (NPS) after 1 month > 40.

Uptime: front-end served with <0.1% error rate in first month.

Scope

In-scope:

Landing page + pricing plans page + login (Discord) + subscription flow (Stripe).

Dashboard page: live signal feed (SSE), historical signal table, basic PnL chart.

Account page: view current plan, billing history, cancel/upgrade.

UI/UX responsive for desktop and mobile.

Logging of client-side errors, basic monitoring.

Deployment with CI/CD to Vercel, versioning, rollback capability.

Out-of-scope:

Advanced analytics (heatmaps, deep backtesting) – planned for later.

Mobile native apps.

Arbitrage or advanced user tools (reserved for phase 2).

Users & Personas

Paid subscriber (trader): Logs in, sees live signals, interprets them to execute trades.

Visitor / prospect: Browses plans, reads about the system, converts to subscriber.

Product owner/UX designer: Tracks conversion funnel, user feedback, UI error logs.

User Stories

As a visitor, I want to see pricing tiers and features so I can decide if subscribing is worthwhile.

As a subscriber, I want to view a live feed of signals with timestamps and details so I can act quickly.

As a subscriber, I want to see my recent trades/history of signals and simple PnL chart so I can review how the system performs.

As a subscriber, I want to upgrade/cancel my plan from my account page so I have control over billing.

Functional Requirements

The site shall offer OAuth login via Discord (NextAuth).

The site shall integrate with Stripe to present pricing plans and handle subscription checkout.

The dashboard shall connect to the /stream/signals SSE endpoint from the API and render a live list (new signals appear at top) with real-time updates.

The dashboard shall also call /signals/historical endpoint and render a table of last 100 signals for user’s plan scope.

The site shall display user account details: plan status, next billing date, billing history, logout.

The site shall function responsively on desktop and mobile (breakpoint targets: ≥ 320px).

Error tracking: client-side errors must be logged (e.g., Sentry) and alert on >5 errors/min.

The site shall deploy via Vercel with automatic build/test on merge to main, and rollback capability.

Non-Functional Requirements

Latency: live signal UI update < 400 ms after API push.

Performance: first meaningful paint ≤ 1 s on standard broadband (desktop).

Reliability: UI handles disconnect/reconnect of SSE stream gracefully (with retry/back-off).

Security: all endpoints via HTTPS, user tokens stored securely (not in localStorage plain), Content Security Policy (CSP) enabled.

Maintainability: component library (Tailwind + React) consistent, code coverage ≥ 80% for critical components.

Accessibility: pages must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards (tab navigation, screen reader labels).

Dependencies

Next.js + Tailwind

API endpoints from repo #2 (auth, SSE, historical signals)

Stripe checkout integration

Discord OAuth via NextAuth

Client-side error tracking (Sentry or similar)

Vercel deployment + CI/CD pipeline

Risks & Mitigations

Risk: Live signal feed floods UI causing lag or freeze. Mitigation: implement throttling, pagination, and UI buffer with max length.

Risk: Subscription conversion too low. Mitigation: optimise landing page, test pricing/timing, A/B tests.

Risk: UI error or disconnection leads to user frustration. Mitigation: show graceful error messages, automatic stream reconnect, analytics to capture errors quickly.

Success Criteria / Acceptance Tests

Visitor journey: landing → login → subscription checkout → dashboard displaying live signals completed without error.

Live feed test: simulated 100 signals/min, UI remains responsive and live updates appear within ~400 ms.

Upgrade flow: user upgrades plan, billing status updates in ≤60 seconds and features enabled accordingly.

UI error rate logs <1% for first 100 user sessions, NPS survey after 1 month shows >40.
